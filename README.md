# Messier 67 Lab (WIP)
This is based on an astrophysics lab that I stumbled upon when cleaning out my old college code and decided to beautify.

This lab's overall goal was to infer the age and metallicity of the stars in the open cluster Messier 67. This was done by comparing the shape of the HR diagram, with magnitudes found through photometry, to models of similar stars. If you don’t understand any of this, but want to, I’ll be trying to explain a lot of the process as I go. 

This is still very much a work in progress and so far I’ve only completed the image calibration and collection of the zero-point. Hopefully I’ll be able to continue adding more over time!
